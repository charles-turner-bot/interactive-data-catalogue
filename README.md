## Features

- **Interactive Catalogue Browsing**: Browse the complete ACCESS-NRI intake catalogue with a responsive data table

- **Datastore Details**: Click through to individual datastores to explore their structure and data
- **Prefetching & Caching**: Intelligent data prefetching and caching for performance
- **Quick Start Code**: Generate Python code snippets for accessing datasets via intake
- **Dark Mode Support**: Toggle between light and dark themes

## Limitations

- You will still require Gadi access to get your hands on the data.
